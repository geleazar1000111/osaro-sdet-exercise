# osaro-sdet-exercise

Running the tests:
    
1. Create a virtual env with `python3 - m venv {name of virtualenv}` then activate it `source {path to venv}/bin/activate`
    
2. Run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to install requirements

3. Go to the /tests directory and run `python3 -m pytest`

There is also the file `git_timestamp.py`. The purpose of this script was to record the timestamps of my commits throughout the exercise.
